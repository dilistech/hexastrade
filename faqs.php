                    <p>
                        All BitCoin operations are confirmed by a BitCoin network. Every single computer in the BitCoin
                        network confirms your transaction, increasing the total number of confirmations. When the number
                        of confirmations reaches a specific threshold, usually from 3 to 6, the funds appear in the
                        recipient account. Usually, such a process takes from up to 90 minutes.
